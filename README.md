## Project 1: Enhancing Image Classification with Wide Residual Networks
### Overview
This project focuses on improving image classification performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Wide Residual Networks (Wide ResNets). Major tasks include:
- Modifying network architecture (depth and width) to find optimal configurations for CIFAR-10 classification.
- Applying MixUp, an advanced data augmentation technique, to expand the training dataset and improve generalization.
- Experimenting with regularization techniques, such as Dropout, to enhance model stability and accuracy.

### Files
- **`Project1_WideResNet_CIFAR10.pdf`**: Detailed project instructions, including architecture and augmentation guidelines.
- **`WideResNet_CIFAR10_Classification.ipynb`**: Notebook for implementing the model, adjusting parameters, and evaluating performance on CIFAR-10.

## Project 2: Transfer Learning for NLP Tasks
### Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of transfer learning on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using pre-trained transformer models. The main tasks include:
- Fine-tuning models on the Yelp Polarity dataset to classify sentiments in customer reviews.
- Applying pre-trained language models to evaluate commonsense reasoning and truthfulness, using datasets such as Piqa and Truthful QA.
- Experimenting with multiple models to solve complex tasks like gap-filling (Winogrande dataset) and question-answering, assessing each model's performance across diverse NLP challenges.

### Files
- **`Transfer_Learning_NLP_Tasks.ipynb`**: Notebook for fine-tuning, experimenting, and evaluating different transformer models on sentiment analysis, commonsense reasoning, and question-answering tasks.
